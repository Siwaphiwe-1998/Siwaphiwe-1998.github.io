                  <p class="w3-container w3-center">
                    On Sunday, the SA Medical Association, said it wanted President Cyril Ramaphosa to urgently intervene as healthcare workers are under severe strain trying to cope with the resurgence of new Covid-19 infections and deaths in the country.
                    The association is calling on the president to take the country back to level 2 lockdown, with particular restrictions on gatherings.

                    “Most of the hospitals are filling up. The real challenge for us with staff is that there is a huge amount of exhaustion. People have been working since the first wave, which was really a lot of pressure and a huge burden as there was no rest. Then of course this came quite soon without most people having to get much rest,” said Mkhize.

                    Meanwhile, Dr Andrea Mendelsohn, a senior Western Cape medical officer, wrote an open letter saying health workers are already tired from the past nine months and many are off sick or in quarantine.

                    According to Mendelsohn, health workers have been getting over 100 patients a day walking in for a Covid evaluation.

                     President Cyril Ramaphosa has lifted the ban on the sale and distribution of alcohol after the country recorded the lowest daily increase in infections on Monday.
                     Ramaphosa addressed the nation on the latest developments in the country in relation to the coronavirus pandemic, which was one of his shortest “family” meetings to date in just 30 minutes.

                    While the Butterworth Dam is at its lowest level in years, and taps in the town and its surrounds are dry, it’s only the poor that suffer. If you can afford it, you can pay people like Similo Mliva and Richard Nobani to bring you water.
                    They sell water which they get from the municipality’s reservoirs to residents for R600 per 2500-litre tank.

                   “We are getting the water from the municipality and sell it to those who can afford it. It’s a business to us and we will make better money if this is prolonged,” said Mliva.

                  <p class="w3-container w3-center">
                    Villagers around the town say they have not had water for week, while some say they ran out of water last year.

                    Residents from suburbs and local townships, such as Mcubakazi, Cuba and Msobomvu, are hardest hit as many don’t have the money to pay to have water carted to their homes, and depend on Amathole District Municipality (ADM) for such services. The municipality will truck water to their communities on a weekly basis.

                    Illegal connections
                  </h3>
                  <p class="w3-container w3-center">
                    An electricity connection is considered illegal when it is made to the Eskom network without Eskom's permission. Examples are connecting to a mini-substation or overhead pole. Doing this poses great risk as it overloads the system, which often causes the power connection to trip or fail, meaning no one in the area would have electricity. It can also cause a fire.
 
                    Another problem with illegal connections is that when Eskom does electricity connections in your community, they look at how much electricity is needed by the number of homes and a certain number of people per home in the area. When you connect illegally, you draw from the same equipment which was meant for a certain number of households, resulting in the equipment being overloaded and the system failing/tripping.
                  </p>
                  <p class="w3-container w3-center">
                    Illegal connections are not safe as they are usually done by unqualified people who not only risk electrocuting themselves, but also expose other people to danger and the risk of injury and death if they make contact with the connection. Not only is this dangerous for the individual making the connection, but it also puts the rest of the community at risk because these connections lie across pathways and walkways where anyone passing by can easily be electrocuted.  An additional risk is that illegally connected wires can also make contact with other items such as roofs, gutters, and washing lines, making these items live and able to conduct electricity.

Since Friday evening, Eskom teams returned four generation units to service at the Medupi Power Station as the coal constraints  improved,” Eskom said in a statement.“Another two units also returned to service during in the same period while the emergency generation reserves have sufficiently recovered.”

                    Eskom also warned that as it continued to implement maintenance on its power plants, the risk of load shedding still remained elevated due to the system being constrained.“We currently have 4 664MW on planned maintenance, while another 13 539MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns. Eskom requests the public to continue using electricity sparingly as the system remains vulnerable and unpredictable.”

                   “The test will be when the tyre hits the ground,” Dr Zweli Mkhize, the minister of health, said this week when he described provincial readiness for the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines to health workers.He said that while there was still anxiety about the rollout in provincial health departments, their efforts would be backed up by research teams from the Medical Research Council.It has been a dramatic week for South Africans, and especially health workers, who are eagerly awaiting vaccination.On Sunday, Professor Shabir Madhi, the principal investigator of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine in South Africa, said their study showed that the vaccine was not protecting recipients from getting mild or moderate Covid-19 caused by the mutation of the virus, first identified in South Africa and named 501.V2. The vaccine only proved 22% efficacious in this respect.
                  </p>
                  <p class="w3-container w3-center">
                    Madhi said data from an American study to test the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine’s efficacy against severe Covid-19, hospitalisation and death is expected soon.South Africa has been hard hit by the virus. The cumulative number of Covid-19 cases on Thursday was 1,484,900.The other two vaccine trials in South Africa – the Novavax vaccine and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine – have shown more promising results.Professor Glenda Gray, the principal investigator of the Johnson & Johnson trial, said their vaccine had an 85% efficacy in preventing severe Covid-19, hospitalisation and death and had been tested in conditions where 501.V2 was the dominant variant.
